# Awesome Codex [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

> A curated list of tools, skills, MCP servers, AGENTS.md patterns, and resources for OpenAI Codex.

[Codex](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/overview) is OpenAI's agentic coding agent — a terminal CLI, an IDE extension, and a cloud environment that share the same agent. This list focuses on the **community ecosystem** around it, plus the official docs worth bookmarking.

**What makes this list different:** it is updated every week, and entries are kept alive. Dead links get removed, not archived. If a section stops being useful, it gets deleted. See [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) for the maintenance contract.

**Legend:** `(Official)` by OpenAI · `(Chinese)` Chinese-language resource · `(Paid)` paid or freemium · everything else is community/open source.
